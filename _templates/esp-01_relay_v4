 This works without hardware modification on the v4.0 module: https://i.imgur.com/p6SVOmA.jpg
 Program your 8 pin ESP 01 chip with Tasmota and add the template above to open and close it. The relay module will have a blue light when it is open.  https://i.imgur.com/nc8CCCn.jpg  There is no add in for the button on the module as it serves as a reset, rather than an on/off switch. 
 
 To make this work with v1.0 of the ESP-01 Relay, you must remove R2 (desolder it or just break it off with a screwdriver), and pull CH_PD high (this is easiest to do with a 10k resistor): https://i.imgur.com/79ySGMt.jpg
 Also, when using a v1.0 relay, you need to change 29 to 21 in the template above, because v1.0 drives the relay non-inverted, whereas v4.0 drives it inverted.
